This project has suffered a major refactor.

Being migrated from [Poi](https://poi.js.org/) to a minimalistic Vue.js site,
crafted from zero ground and not attached to any generator (Just plain Vue ðŸ˜‹)

Now working with [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org), ant trying to retaking my personal blog

Hope it enjoy better this time...
